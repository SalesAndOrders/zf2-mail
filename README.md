Options
-------

Thus module has some options to allow you to quickly customize the basic
functionality.

The following options are available:

- **domains** - A array of key value pairs. The default key is used for email addresses that did not specify any domain
- **transport** - The specification for the email transport. A `type` and `options` key can be specified
- **from** - An array of arrays where each inner array should specify the `name` and `email` keys. Optionally an `domain`
key can be specified that is available in the `domains` option. If no `domain` is specified, `default` is used.
- **layouts** - An array of array where each inner array can specify a `plain` and/or `html` key. The value for these
keys should point to view file that you have defined in the `view_manager` configuration. Hence, the view manager
from the application is used to locate the view script.
- **mails** - An array of arrays where each inner array can specify the following options: `from`, a value that points to
a key in the `from` options array. `layout`: a value that points to a key in the `layouts` array. If not specified, no
layout is used. `subject`: the subject of the email. If not specified the `subject` in `template` will be used.
`template`: an array containing the keys `html`, `plain` and `subject`. These should point to a view
script specified by the `view_manager`.

Send email
-------
Let `$emailService` be an instanceof `Mailing\Service`. (Can be obtained with the `MailingServiceProviderTrait`). An
email is then send with `$email->sendMail($message, 'alias', $variables)`. The `$message` variable is an instance of
`Zend\Mail\Message` and you should specify addresses in this object. The second parameter is a key in the `mails` array
specified in the configuration. Variables can be passed as last parameter. These will be available in your view script.
